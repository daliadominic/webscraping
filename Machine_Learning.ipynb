    "#xx = pd.DataFrame({'Content':['\"623. 7. 4. Featured. You can make this recipe in a 10-inch springform pan. However, I like to make this coffee cake into smaller servings. I usually split the recipe in half since Iâ€™m only cooking for two. I use three 4-inch springform pans to bake the coffee cake and spread them out between a couple days. The coffee cakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. My husband and I like to split a mini coffee cake in the mornings with some hot tea or have it in the late afternoon as a snack. This recipe can also be found at gardengirlrecipes.com.. .. Ingredients. STREUSEL:Â½ cup light brown sugar. Â½ cup rolled oats. â…“ cup all purpose flour. Â¼ teaspoon salt. 6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces. COFFEE CAKE:2 cups fresh blueberries. 2 cups + 2 tbsp all purpose flour. 1 tablespoon baking powder. 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Â½ teaspoon saltÂ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg. 2/3 cup whole milk, at room temperature. 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature plus more for coating. Â½ cup + 2 tbsp packed light brown sugar. Â½ cup + 2 tbsp granulated sugar. 2 large eggs, at room temperature. Teachers! Did you use this instructable in your classroom? Add a Teacher Note to share how you incorporated it into your lesson.. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Then combine all the dry ingredients for the streusel.. Add the butter and place in the fridge until ready to use.. Combine 2 cups of flour with the baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.. Coat the blueberries in 2 tablespoons of flour.. Combine the milk and the vanilla extract.. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the sugars and the butter.. Add the eggs one at a time.. Add a third of the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Then add a third of the milk mixture and mix until just incorporated. Repeat until all the flour and milk have been thoroughly combined. (Do not overmix or the cake will be tough).. Fold in the blueberries leaving the excess flour.. Coat a 10-inch springform pan with butter. Then line the bottom with parchment paper and coat the parchment with butter.. Fill the springform pan with the batter.. Remove the streusel from the fridge and sprinkle it on top of the batter.. Bake until the top is golden brown, about 55 to 60 minutes.. Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 20 minutes.. Participated in the Baking Challenge.
